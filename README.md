# Wireless Traffic Prediction
This project generates comperative prediction performance results for both Web traffic and M2M traffic using LSTM and ARIMA.
This performance results are necessary for the cloud and network resource allocation by the cloud orchestrator and SDN. 
Both ARIMA and LSTM takes two datasets (train and test) and generates prediction results for both dataset.
